# Backend API Environment Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: This directory uses the root .env file for configuration
# Main configuration file: ../../.env
#
# The root .env file contains all necessary environment variables
# with proper prefixes (DATABASE_, SECURITY_, etc.)
#
# If you need to override specific backend settings, you can create
# a local .env file here, but it's recommended to use the root .env
# for consistency across the entire project.
